Most interesting:
*Nuclear - fission reactors, small missiles
*Hydrogen(light gases) - fusion reactors, big missiles
*Noble gases - shields, cloaks
*Hydrocarbons - polymers(plastic)


Ideas: silicon, different metals, explosives, consumables, reactor fuel, wire, magazines(used in blueprints), polymer, oil/coal/gas, different gases, liquids, glass, luxury resources(rare), livestock, psionic crap, tools, power sources other than fusion, capacitor

Desert - silicon
Green - oil

Fuel used for energy-intensive stuff, like warp gates

Future questions:
*The basis of technology. How do engines, weapons, shields, construction work in-lore?
