I got a fireteam out in yon Asteroid Belt needing backup, stat!\nA whole spawn cluster of Mites has been up our bungholes for the past few weeks. We deployed to stop 'em chewing up the ore refineries out there, but you know how Mites are - just kept multiplying. Worse still, the buggers got one of our two ships, and when I evac'ed to get help the upper brass said we're on our own.\nI'm begging you [sir/ma'am], you gotta save my boys. We aren't well-funded out here, but I'll make it up to you however I can. Maybe put in a good word for you to the supes if you wanna freelance in these parts. Whaddya say?",

These blokes are the closest stuff to family I have these days. Are you planning on sticking 'round these parts? If so, we could use you - I got my team back but we're down a ship, and resupply takes ages out here… they keep saying it's a paperwork issue."

Well, we now know why: completely overtaken by Mites. Those big drills, processing plants, and ingot vaults have probably been breakfast, lunch, and dinner to a couple dozen Mite generations already, but that'll climb to hundreds unless we do something quick.\nWhaddya say, ace? You've clocked some good practice against Mites already, and I don't think my boys and I can put a stop to this with just one ship.",

Don't be surprised if they come a-knocking with some fat commissions for you? The brass know I have an eye for talent - 'When Brax says someone's the tops, we listen,' they always say.\nOh, I finally got word that I'm getting a second ship, so us professionals should have the Mites under control from here. But I got plenty more for you to do besides… all above board, of course (nervous cough)."
