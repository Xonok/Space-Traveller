#anomalies are objects in random places on the map
#when investigated, an event happens. Events can mean several things:
#*a choice
#*loot
#*enemies spawn and attack
#*player chooses to cancel
#each is accompanied by text
#choices essentially redirect to other events
#when the event chain is exhausted, the anomaly disappears.
#rewards should only happen at the end, to prevent exploits.

#anomalies appear randomly on any tile. 
#there can be restrictions on what tiles are valid
#anomalies are visible on the map, with multiple options for images
#there should be a limit on the total amount of anomalies, and on those of any given type
