Rabbitholes are spirally wormholes where the spiral is drawn with a pink-purple gradient.

Rabbitholes lead to a special constellation known as rabbit-space, where the number of accessible stars and the connections between them are random.
Some /wormholes/ lead out of rabbitspace to random places in the universe.

Every once in a while the entrances to rabbitspace move and the connections within the space randomize again.
Entering rabbitspace puts you on top of a random wormhole or rabbithole in the space - it might not be the one that would lead you back - there might not even a wormhole in the entirety of rabbitspace that leads to where you came from.
Leaving rabbitspace places you on a random wormhole in the universe.

A special item or skill might show the timer for when rabbitspace will change again.
