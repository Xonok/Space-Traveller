Bring me the materials to rebuild the satellites.\nI’ve heard Phantom is taking materials in trade. You need to get them four hundred units of metal and one hundred microchips. Metal is in the asteroid field southeast of here. You’ll need a mining laser to dig it up and a mini smelter to process it.\nMicrochips you can buy from Bastion out west, or make yourself if you know how.\nIf this works, maybe we’ll get comms back.\nIf not... Well, I don’t even want to think about that.",
