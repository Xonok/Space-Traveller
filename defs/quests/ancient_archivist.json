It greets you with an inhumanly pitch-perfect voice: 'Greetings, traveller. I am Xzx5870, a fifth generation Interactive Encyclopedia on the topic of the Ancients. Are you here to assist with research? Yes/No.'\nAfter asking what's an encyclopedia and receiving a definition, you affirm that yes, you are indeed interested in the job, although you don't know what exactly you'd have to do.\nAs it answers, the robot begins to slowly drive toward you and the edge of the pedestal it's on.\n'Simple. Receive instructions, bring required items. Reward: credits and access to lectures.'\nIt states and falls off of the pedestal. Crashing into the floor makes several bits and pieces fly off and severely dents one side of the robot.\nIt tries to continue the conversation, but its voice is now distorted:\n'Do yOu â˜†acCePT_ workx/zzz job?'",

Lecture passwords will be transmitted to your ship shortly.'",
